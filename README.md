Project Overview

This project explores the structure of perfect and pseudoperfect numbers as quantified by a notion of entropy defined in terms of the divisors of these numbers. The main goal is to investigate whether entropy provides insights into the existence of odd perfect numbersâ€”a long-standing unsolved problem in mathematics.
Please see the project_overview.ipynb file for a more detailed overview.

Key Concepts

Perfect Numbers: A number whose divisors (excluding itself) sum to the number itself. Examples include 6, 28, 496, and 8128.

Pseudoperfect Numbers: A broader category where some subset of divisors sums to the number. Perfect numbers are a special case of pseudoperfect numbers.

Perfection Entropy: A measure I created that characterises pseudoperfect numbers based on how some subset of their divisors contribute to their sum.

Empirical Findings

The entropy of odd pseudoperfect numbers is observed to be higher than that of even pseudoperfect numbers.

Perfect numbers exhibit a converging pattern of entropy values, suggesting potential links between entropy and number classification.

Conjectures

The entropy of odd pseudoperfect numbers is bounded below by approximately 2.55.
The entropy of perfect numbers does not exceed 2.
